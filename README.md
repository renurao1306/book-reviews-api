## Design Decisions & Assumptions

- JWT Authentication is used to protect private routes.

- bcrypt hashes passwords for security.

- Each user can post one review per book (optional enhancement).

- MongoDB is used for its flexibility and document-based schema.



---


## Brief Schema Design

**1. Users Schema**
```json
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  username: String (unique, required),
  password: String (hashed, required)
}
```

**2. Books Schema**
```json
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  title: String (required),
  author: String (required),
  genre: String (required),
  reviews: [ObjectId] // Array of Review references
}
```

**3. Reviews Schema**
```json
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  book: ObjectId (ref: 'Book', required),
  user: ObjectId (ref: 'User', required),
  rating: Number (1â€“5, required),
  comment: String (optional),
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

**Relationships**

- A User can create multiple Reviews.

- A Book can have multiple Reviews.

- Each Review is linked to exactly one User and one Book.

- A User can review a Book only once.
